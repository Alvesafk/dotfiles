# dotfiles

Dotfiles of the applications that i typically use.

It also contains scripts to install and configure automatically the applications and configs.

To run the scripts go to the `scripts` folder of the repository and in the terminal do `./(script that you want to use)`, it should install and configure everything with my configs, minus the gitconfig.sh, that one is a script that configures your Git and can even generate a ssh key for you, just follow the instructions that the script gives you.

Just a heads up, the scripts are written to work on Arch Linux, so they wont work unless you have the pacman package manager in your machine.
